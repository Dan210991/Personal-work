# Personal-work
A collection of personal work and challenges I've done throughout my years at university.


Dissertation_Artefact - 
My final peice of work, this studies how social media can be used to report on opinions and trends.
By using a twitter developer account and accessing twitter via provided API keys this program searched for
desired terms and returned tweets that matched the search term. Sentiment analysis was then carried out on the gathered tweets
with them being sorted in positive/negative or neutral terms.

Java_Work -
This work was taken from a module that covered Advanced software Engineering topics.
The module was based around given code that contained bad smells and coding practices,
throughout the module these bad practices were identified and an instance of each was fixed and documented.
This module was also used for practicing coding patterns and functional programming.
